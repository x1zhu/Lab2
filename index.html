                     <h2>Introduction</h2>
                     <p><i><b>Mount Fuji</b> </i>(富士山, Fujisan, Japanese: [ɸɯꜜ(d)ʑisaɴ] (About this soundlisten)), <strong>located on the island of Honshū, is the highest mountain in Japan</strong>, standing 3,776.24 m (12,389.2 ft). <strong> is the second-highest volcano located on an island in Asia (after Mount Kerinci on the island of Sumatra)</strong>, and seventh-highest peak of an island on Earth.[1] Mount Fuji is an active stratovolcano that last erupted from 1707 to 1708.[4][5] The mountain is located about 100 km (62 mi) southwest of Tokyo and is visible from there on clear days. Mount Fuji's exceptionally symmetrical cone, which is covered in snow for about five months of the year, is commonly used as a cultural icon of Japan and it is frequently depicted in art and photography, as well as visited by sightseers and climbers.[6]

                        Mount Fuji is one of Japan's "Three Holy Mountains" <strong>(三霊山, Sanreizan)</strong> along with Mount Tate and Mount Haku. It is a Special Place of Scenic Beauty and one of Japan's Historic Sites.[7] It was added to the World Heritage List as a Cultural Site on June 22, 2013.[7] <em><strong>According to UNESCO, Mount Fuji has "inspired artists and poets and been the object of pilgrimage for centuries".</strong></em> UNESCO recognizes 25 sites of cultural interest within the Mount Fuji locality. These 25 locations include the mountain and the Shinto shrine, Fujisan Hongū Sengen Taisha, as well as the Buddhist Taisekiji Head Temple founded in 1290, later depicted by Japanese ukiyo-e artist Katsushika Hokusai.</p>

                    <h3>将进酒
                        Bring in the Wine
                    </h3><br>
                    
                        <p>李白〔唐代〕<br></p>

君不见黄河之水天上来，奔流到海不复回。<br>
Have you not seen，that the waters of the Yellow River come from upon Heaven,surging into the ocean, never to return again;<br>
君不见高堂明镜悲白发，朝如青丝暮成雪。<br>
Have you not seen, in great halls' bright mirrors, they grieve over white hair,at dawn like black threads, by evening becoming snow.<br>
人生得意须尽欢，莫使金樽空对月。<br>
In human life, accomplishment must bring total joy, do not allow an empty goblet to face the moon.<br>
天生我材必有用，千金散尽还复来。<br>
Heaven made me - my abilities must have a purpose; I spend a thousand gold pieces completely, but they'll come back again.<br>
烹羊宰牛且为乐，会须一饮三百杯。<br>
Boil a lamb, butcher an ox - now we shall be joyous; we must drink three hundred cups all at once!<br>
岑夫子，丹丘生，将进酒，杯莫停。<br>
Master Cen, Dan Qiusheng, bring in the wine! the cups must not stop!<br>
与君歌一曲，请君为我倾耳听。<br>
I'll sing you a song, I ask that you lend me your ears.<br>
钟鼓馔玉不足贵，但愿长醉不愿醒。<br>
Bells, drums, delicacies, jade - they are not fine enough; I only wish to be forever drunk and never sober again.<br>
古来圣贤皆寂寞，惟有饮者留其名。<br>
Since ancient times, sages have all been solitary; only a drinker can leave his name behind!<br>
陈王昔时宴平乐，斗酒十千恣欢谑。<br>
The Prince of Chen, in times past, held feasts at Pingle; ten thousand cups of wine - abandon restraint and be merry!<br>
主人何为言少钱，径须沽取对君酌。<br>
Why would a host speak of having little money? you must go straight and buy it - I'll drink it with you!<br>
五花马、千金裘，呼儿将出换美酒，与尔同销万古愁。<br>
My lovely horse,my furs worth a thousand gold pieces, call the boy and have him take them to be swapped for fine wine, and together with you I'll wipe out the cares of ten thousand ages.<br>
